# TerribleWebroxy
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hi, this is a terrible web proxy made in Node.JS, inspiration was taken from Ultraviolet, (TN) Corrosion, (TN) Alloy, (TN) Aero, (NEB) and Womginx (IDK)

It was made pretty much only with ChatGPT, made by OpenAI and Ghostwriter, made by Replit.

Originally used HTTP, (veri poopy) but now uses websocket.

As of now, uses Express, HTTP-proxy-middleware, and compression.

Features: Uhhhhh, uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, uhh, uh uhhhhhh, uh. Fast? (I think)
